This is a simple exaple of low-level coding in C. Together with many other little projects in C, I was asked to realize it during Informatics Fundamentals, my first course at university.
It's simple, but I'm fond of it.
Anyway, it contains the creation of a linked list and then some manipulation on it: head insert, tail insert, visit, swap consecutive elements, bubble sort algorithm.

I apologize to those who don't understand Italian, my professor wanted me to code in Italian.
